## Current Features
- Fully modern C++17 kernel

- Own bootloader for both x86 and x86-64
- Basic SMP (multicore) support
---
## Getting started

### Windows

Windows support is fully based on WSL, so you can't currently build the system without it.

- Install QEMU, add it into your `Path`
- Install WSL Ubuntu, or any other distro with apt
- Install nasm for your WSL
- run `run_qemu.bat`

### Linux
- Install QEMU
- Install nasm
- run `run_qemu.sh`
---
Virtualization software other than QEMU (like VMware, VirtualBox) is also usable by manually loading the VMDK image from `Images` (generated via `Scripts/build_ultra.{sh/bat}`).
